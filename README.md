# Solanum - Web Server Framework Based on Gin

**Solanum** is a lightweight, Gin-based web framework for Go that brings a clean modular structure and built-in dependency injection (DI). It makes it easy to organize your routes, middleware, and service dependencies in a scalable, testable way.

## Features

- **Modular Architecture**  
  Define self-contained `Module`s, each with its own URI prefix, middleware, controllers, and dependencies.

- **Controller & Service Layer**  
  Organize handlers as `SolaService` entries within `Controller`s, enabling clear separation of concerns.

- **Dependency Injection Container**  
  Register providers (factory functions or concrete instances) with singleton or transient scope, support init hooks, and resolve by key or Go interface type.

- **Flexible CORS Support**  
  Fluent API for configuring origins, methods, headers, credentials, and max age.
